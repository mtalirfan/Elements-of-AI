Exercise 10: Bayes rule (part 1 of 2)

Apply the Bayes rule to calculate the posterior odds for rain having observed clouds in the morning in Helsinki.

As we calculated above, the prior odds for rain is 206:159 and the likelihood ratio for observing clouds is 9.

Give your result in the form of odds, xx:yy, where xx and yy are numbers. (Note that xx and yy does not mean that the numbers should have two digits each.) Remember that when multiplying odds, you should only multiply the numerator (the xx part). For example, if you multiply the odds 5:3 by 5, the result is 25:3. Give the answer without simplifying the expression even if both sides have a common factor.

Your answer:

1854:159


Your answer is correct

Correct. The prior odds are 206:159. The likelihood ratio is 9, so we get the posterior odds for rain given clouds to be 9 Ã— 206:159 = 1854:159. So in the long run, on the days when we observe clouds in the morning, we can expect 1854 rainy days for every 159 rainless days, which is about the same as 12 rainy days for one rainless day. If we wanted to express this as a probability (even though this was not the question), we could use the formula x / (x+y) to get the value 1854 / (1854+159) which is about 0.92, or about 92% chance of rain when there are clouds in the morning. Better take an umbrella.
