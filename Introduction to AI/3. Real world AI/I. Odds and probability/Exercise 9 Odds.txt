Exercise 9: Odds

As we already mentioned above, the odds 3:1 – for example three rainy days for each rainless day – corresponds to probability 0.75 (or in percentages 75%).

In general, if the odds in favor of an event are x:y, the probability of the event is given by x / (x+y). Try that with the odds 3:1 if you like. You should get the answer 0.75.

As we also pointed out, the odds 6:2 corresponds to exactly the same probability as the odds 3:1 because when we let x=6 and y=2, and write them in the formula x / (x+y), we get 6/(6+2), which comes out as 6/8 = 3/4 = 0.75.

Your task:

For the first three items 1–3, convert from odds to probabilities expressed as natural frequencies; for example from 1:1 to 1/2. Give your answer as a fraction, for example 2/3.

For the last three items 4–6, convert the odds into probabilities expressed as percentages (e.g. 4.2%). Give your answer in percentages using a single decimal, for example 12.2%.

Hint: the calculations are to be calculated with a simple calculator and the formulas can be found above.


The odds for getting three of a kind in poker are about 1:46.

Your answer:
1/47


Your answer is correct

Correct. There are 46 situations where you do not get three of a kind for one where you get it, so the probability is 1/(1+46) = 1/47.

The odds for rain in Helsinki are 206:159.

Your answer:
206/365


Your answer is correct

Correct. There are 206 rainy days for 159 dry days, so the probability is 206/(206+159) = 206/365.

The odds for rain in San Diego are 23:342.

Your answer:
23/365


Your answer is correct

The odds for getting three of a kind in poker are about 1:46.

Your answer:
2.1%


Your answer is correct

Correct. Previously we had the probability as 1/(1+ 46) = 1/47, which gives us roughly 0.0213, which rounds to 2.1%.

The odds for rain in Helsinki are 206:159.

Your answer:
56.4%


Your answer is correct

The odds for rain in San Diego are 23:342.

Your answer:
