Exercise 8: Probabilistic forecasts

For this exercise, remember the key points from the above discussion: probability can be quantified (expressed as a number) and it can be right or wrong. But also keep in mind, that it is usually not possible to draw conclusions about whether a particular number was right or wrong based on a single observation.

Consider the following four probabilistic forecasts and outcomes. What can we conclude based on the outcome about the correctness of the forecasts? Can we conclude that the probability given by the forecast was indeed the correct probability (choose "right"), that the forecast was wrong (choose "wrong"), or can we conclude neither way (choose "cannot be concluded")?


The weather forecast says it's going to rain with 90% probability tomorrow but the day turns out to be all sun and no rain.
Cannot be concluded

The weather forecast says it's going to rain with 0% probability tomorrow but the day turns out to be rainy.
Wrong

Suppose you monitor a weather forecaster for a long time. You only consider the days for which the forecast gives 80% chance of rain. You find that in the long run, on the average it rains on three out of every five days.
Wrong

In the United States presidential election 2016, a well-known political forecast blog, Five-Thirty-Eight, gave Clinton a 71.4% chance of winning (vs Trump's 28.6%). However, contrary to the prediction, Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.
Cannot be concluded
