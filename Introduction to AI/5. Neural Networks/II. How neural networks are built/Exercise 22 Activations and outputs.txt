Exercise 22: Activations and outputs

Below are graphs for three different activation functions with different properties. First we have the sigmoid function, then the step function, and finally the identity function. IMPORTANT: Note the different y-axis (vertical) scale in the identity function chart.

Which of the activations described above gives:
the highest output for an input of 5?
Identity

the lowest output for an input of -5?
Identity

the highest output for an input of -2.5?
Sigmoid
