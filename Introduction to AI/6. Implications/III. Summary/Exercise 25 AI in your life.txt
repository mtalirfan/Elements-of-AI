Example answer

We genuinely look forward to what tomorrow has in store for us. At work, new assisting technologies emerge and existing ones mature to the point of being less annoying than useful. We'll be able to complete our work more efficiently when interacting with machines takes less effort, and we can spend more time interacting with our colleagues and our loved ones.

In our everyday life, we are curious to see AI applications in entertainment such as movies and games. The ways in which we (everyone) use social media and access information online need to change, with more respect for privacy and truthfulness. An end needs to be put to the post-truth era, which is in part a consequence of filter bubbles created by AI algorithms. In this respect, we hope that the balance will tip more towards the good uses of AI and away from the bad ones. Personally, we will do our very best to contribute to this process.

Above all, we will be excited to hear back from you and learn about what we can achieve together by investing time and effort in open AI education, learning about AI, and using our improved understanding to do wonderful things.
