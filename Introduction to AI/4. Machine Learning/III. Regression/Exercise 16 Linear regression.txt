Exercise 16: Linear regression

Suppose that an extensive study is carried out, and it is found that in a particular country, the life expectancy (the average number of years that people live) among non-smoking women who don't eat any vegetables is 80 years. Suppose further that on the average, men live 5 years less. Also take the numbers mentioned above: every cigarette per day reduces the life expectancy by half a year, and a handful of veggies per day increases it by one year.

Calculate the life expectancies for the following example cases:

For example, the first case is a male (subtract 5 years), smokes 8 cigarettes per day (subtract 8 × 0.5 = 4 years), and eats two handfuls of veggies per day (add 2 × 1 = 2 years), so the predicted life expectancy is 80 - 5 - 4 + 2 = 73 years.

Gender	Smoking (cigarettes per day)	Vegetables (handfuls per day)	Life expectancy (years)
male	8	2	73
male	0	6	A
female	16	1	B
female	0	4	C
Your task: Enter the correct value as an integer (whole number) for the missing sections A, B, and C above.

A

Your answer:
81


Your answer is correct

Correct. A: 80 - 5 + 6 = 81

B

Your answer:
73


Your answer is correct

Correct. 80 - 8 + 1 = 73

C

Your answer:
84


Your answer is correct

Correct. 80 + 4 = 84
