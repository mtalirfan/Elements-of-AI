Three types of machine learning
The roots of machine learning are in statistics, which can also be thought of as the art of extracting knowledge from data. Especially methods such as linear regression and Bayesian statistics, which are both already more than two centuries old (!), are even today at the heart of machine learning. For more examples and a brief history, see the timeline of machine learning (Wikipedia).

The area of machine learning is often divided in subareas according to the kinds of problems being attacked. A rough categorization is as follows:

Supervised learning: We are given an input, for example a photograph with a traffic sign, and the task is to predict the correct output or label, for example which traffic sign is in the picture (speed limit, stop sign, etc.). In the simplest cases, the answers are in the form of yes/no (we call these binary classification problems).

Unsupervised learning: There are no labels or correct outputs. The task is to discover the structure of the data: for example, grouping similar items to form “clusters”, or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”. Data visualization can also be considered unsupervised learning.

Reinforcement learning: Commonly used in situations where an AI agent like a self-driving car must operate in an environment and where feedback about good or bad choices is available with some delay. Also used in games where the outcome may be decided only at the end of the game.

The categories are somewhat overlapping and fuzzy, so a particular method can sometimes be hard to place in one category. For example, as the name suggests, so-called semisupervised learning is partly supervised and partly unsupervised.
