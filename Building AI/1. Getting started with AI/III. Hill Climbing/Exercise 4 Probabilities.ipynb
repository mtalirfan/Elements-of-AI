    "We will use probability to make our optimization techniques better by helping them escape local optima. Consider the following small-scale example. The goal is to have a ball land at the lowest point, marked by B below, on a bumpy surface.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ball is initially in point D, which is a local optimum. Suppose the you can shake the surface to make the ball bounce around. If you shake the surface gently, the ball will be unlikely to escape its initial position D. If you give the surface a single very strong jerk, the ball will bounce randomly and then roll down the hill to a local optimum which may or may not be the global optimum B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following shaking strategies you think will most likely succeed in having the ball land at the lowest point B after you stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Shaking the surface first strongly and then gradually more gently will most likely succeed. If you start by shaking the surface gently, the ball will unlikely escape the local optimum D. On the other hand, if you shake the surface strongly at the end, the ball will bounce to a random position and the roll down to a local optimum. Starting with strong shaking will first have the ball bouncing randomly but then as you reduce the strength, the lower the position of the ball, the more unlikely it is to bounce over the high \"barriers\" around the local optima."
