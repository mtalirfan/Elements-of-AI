    "1D simulated annealing: modify the program below to use simulated annealing instead of plain hill climbing. In simulated annealing the probability of accepting a solution that lowers the score is given by prob = exp(-(S_old - S_new)/T). Setting the temperature T and gradually decreasing can be done in many ways, some of which lead to better outcomes than others. A good choice in this case is for example: T = 2*max(0, ((steps-step*1.2)/steps))**3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code produces something like the following chart, where the black box marks the starting point. The code below uses the plain hill-climbing strategy to only go up towards a peak. The solution is marked by a red star. As you can see, the hill-climbing strategy tends to get stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to modify the code to use simulated annealing. Use the cooling schedule for setting the temperature provided above, and modify the acceptance criterion from only accepting upward moves to accepting also downward moves with the proper probability. Remember that in this exercise the score in simulated annealing is the height of a given location on the mountain. Also note that you will need to handle T=0 case separately, since the acceptance probability for a worse score should be zero for zero temperature, but the formula used for the probability will result in division by zero.\n",
