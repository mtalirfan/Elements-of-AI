    "Imagine that you've been assigned the task to plan the route of a container ship loaded with pineapples. The ship starts in Panama, loaded with delicious Fairtrade pineapples. There are four other ports, New York, Casablanca, Amsterdam, and Helsinki, where pineapple-craving citizens are eagerly waiting. The ship must visit each of the four destination ports exactly once, but the order in which each port is visited is free. The goal is to minimize the carbon emissions, which means that a shorter route is better than a longer one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, it is enough to list all the possible routes that start from Panama and visit each of the other ports exactly once, calculate the carbon emissions of each route, and print out the one with the least emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider each stage separately, starting from listing all the possible alternatives. The term used by programmers is enumerate. So we'll first enumerate all the possible routes. Those of you who are well-versed in combinatorics (the part of mathematics that deals with combinations of finite sets of objects) will know that the number of routes is 4×3×2×1=24."

    "The easiest way to do this is by the programming technique called recursion. If you are not familiar with it, this is a nice opportunity to learn (see for example here).

To remove item i from the list, you can write ports[:i]+ports[i+1:]."
