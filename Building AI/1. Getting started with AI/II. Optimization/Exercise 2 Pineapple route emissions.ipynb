    "Just listing the alternatives is not very useful but at least it helps us realize that the number of routes is starting to be so big that finding the best one manually would be a chore. There are 24 routes for five ports (one of which is the starting point). If some pineapples were also wanted in, say, London, it could be added in the route in five different positions, so the number of routes would become 5×24=120. With yet another destination, this number would be multiplied by 6, to get 6×120=720 different routes, and so on.\n",

    "An automatic solution using a computer can take us much further. However, without some clever strategies to reduce the workload, even a computer will choke sooner or later. Which is where the more advanced AI techniques step in. But let's not rush ahead of ourselves before we have to – let's work out our route to get the pineapples delivered to the four cities with minimal carbon emissions.\n",

Thus, you can calculate the emissions caused by traveling from Panama to Amsterdam by first looking up the distance in the first row, second column of the table (highlighted in the above table): 8943 km, and then multiplying this with 0.020kg/km to get 178.9 kg."
