This happens because the program will compare every row also with itself. To avoid selecting those elements, you can assign the value np.inf (the maximum possible floating point value). To do this, it's necessary to make sure the type of the array is float. Do not use np.float to set the type of the array, as it is deprecated. Use Python's built-in type float instead.\n",
